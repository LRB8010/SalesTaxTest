#Sales Tax

## Overview

This small application was made to help calculate sales tax on a variety of items.
While planning this app, I really did go down a deep rabbit hole! There are so many technologies out there
and I couldn't decide which one to pick. In the end, I ended up going with something simple, a Forms app. I choose
this because I wanted to challenge myself and learn something new along the way. Plus it has a heavy use of C#,
so it's a win-win!

### Requirements

(Optional)Visual Studios 2022

### Installation

To run the application first you should 'Build' it.
There is a variety of ways to 'Build' a solution depending on what code editor you are using.
I will be giving an example using Visual Studios 2022.
To Build, simply click on the Build button located on the toolbar at the top of the Visual Studio window, then click on Build Solution
from the drop-down menu.

You could also use this keyboard shortcut instead for the same outcome, Ctrl+Shift+B

You should see the progress of the build at the bottom of the 'Output' window. 
Once done you should see a 'Build: 1 succeeded'.

Now finally click on the green arrow with the words 'SalesTax' next to it to launch the app!

### Usage

To use this app, you need to make sure there are no empty fields when adding an item to the basket. If there are empty fields, it will
prompt you to fill them in when the 'Add To Basket' button is clicked.

Once you add an item to your basket, the item should appear at the bottom.

The 'Empty Basket' button can be clicked to empty your basket if desired.

If you are happy with the items in your basket, click on the 'Total' button at the bottom to generate a receipt with the total price
and sales tax.
